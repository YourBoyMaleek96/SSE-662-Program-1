# Project Overview
This project aims to Develop a simple command-line T0-Do List using Go. The program will allow users to add tasks with a brief description, display existing tasks with their status, mark tasks as done, delete tasks, and provide a help menu that shows users how to use each command.  

# Usage Instructions 
Once the code is run user can enter the following from the command line: 
                                    add                     - Add a new task with the given description.

	                                done <task_number>      - Mark the task with the given number as done.
	                                delete <task_number>    - Delete the task with the given number.
